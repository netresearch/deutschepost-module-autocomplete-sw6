**DATAFACTORY Autocomplete** is a service of Deutsche Post Direkt, 100 % subsidiary of the worldâ€™s leading mail and logistics company Deutsche Post DHL Group, specialized in address and data management.
The service offers effective assistance with incomplete address data.

This module integrates DATAFACTORY Autocomplete services into Shopware 6 so that your customers can now supplement their postal data easily.
As soon as your customers enter the first alphanumerical characters in an address input field, they will receive up to 15 suggestions for valid German addresses.
A total of around 1.2 million different address suggestions are available, including all delivery-relevant streets, more than 16,000 postal codes and destinations, 14,000 towns/cities, 75,000 district names.
The basis for automatic completion is the street directory based on the original postal routing data of the Deutsche Post.
